COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

APPROLEASSIGNMENT <IMicrosoftGraphAppRoleAssignmentAutoGenerated2[]>: Represents the app roles a user has been granted for an application. Supports $expand.
  [DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]: 
  [Id <String>]: Read-only.
  [AppRoleId <String>]: The identifier (id) for the app role which is assigned to the principal. This app role must be exposed in the appRoles property on the resource application's service principal (resourceId). If the resource application has not declared any app roles, a default app role ID of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 can be specified to signal that the principal is assigned to the resource app without any specific app roles. Required on create.
  [CreatedDateTime <DateTime?>]: The time when the app role assignment was created.The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z. Read-only.
  [PrincipalDisplayName <String>]: The display name of the user, group, or service principal that was granted the app role assignment. Read-only. Supports $filter (eq and startswith).
  [PrincipalId <String>]: The unique identifier (id) for the user, group or service principal being granted the app role. Required on create.
  [PrincipalType <String>]: The type of the assigned principal. This can either be User, Group or ServicePrincipal. Read-only.
  [ResourceDisplayName <String>]: The display name of the resource app's service principal to which the assignment is made.
  [ResourceId <String>]: The unique identifier (id) for the resource service principal for which the assignment is made. Required on create. Supports $filter (eq only).

IDENTITY <IMicrosoftGraphObjectIdentity[]>: Represents the identities that can be used to sign in to this user account. An identity can be provided by Microsoft (also known as a local account), by organizations, or by social identity providers such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, and tied to a user account. May contain multiple items with the same signInType value. Supports $filter (eq) only where the signInType is not userPrincipalName.
  [Issuer <String>]: Specifies the issuer of the identity, for example facebook.com.For local accounts (where signInType is not federated), this property is the local B2C tenant default domain name, for example contoso.onmicrosoft.com.For external users from other Azure AD organization, this will be the domain of the federated organization, for example contoso.com.Supports $filter. 512 character limit.
  [IssuerAssignedId <String>]: Specifies the unique identifier assigned to the user by the issuer. The combination of issuer and issuerAssignedId must be unique within the organization. Represents the sign-in name for the user, when signInType is set to emailAddress or userName (also known as local accounts).When signInType is set to: emailAddress, (or a custom string that starts with emailAddress like emailAddress1) issuerAssignedId must be a valid email addressuserName, issuerAssignedId must be a valid local part of an email addressSupports $filter. 100 character limit.
  [SignInType <String>]: Specifies the user sign-in types in your directory, such as emailAddress, userName or federated. Here, federated represents a unique identifier for a user from an issuer, that can be in any format chosen by the issuer. Additional validation is enforced on issuerAssignedId when the sign-in type is set to emailAddress or userName. This property can also be set to any custom string.

PASSWORDPROFILE <IMicrosoftGraphPasswordProfile>: passwordProfile
  [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
  [ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn <Boolean?>]: true if the user must change her password on the next login; otherwise false. If not set, default is false. NOTE:  For Azure B2C tenants, set to false and instead use custom policies and user flows to force password reset at first sign in. See Force password reset at first logon.
  [ForceChangePasswordNextSignInWithMfa <Boolean?>]: If true, at next sign-in, the user must perform a multi-factor authentication (MFA) before being forced to change their password. The behavior is identical to forceChangePasswordNextSignIn except that the user is required to first perform a multi-factor authentication before password change. After a password change, this property will be automatically reset to false. If not set, default is false.
  [Password <String>]: The password for the user. This property is required when a user is created. It can be updated, but the user will be required to change the password on the next login. The password must satisfy minimum requirements as specified by the user’s passwordPolicies property. By default, a strong password is required.
